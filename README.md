# How to run the program
Run the program with command: **gradlew run --args="<YOUTRACK_INSTANCE_URL> <YOUTRACK_USER_TOKEN>"**  
(for example: gradlew run --args="https://my-youtrack-instance.com my_youtrack_token")

> **Note:** On macOS/Linux, the command might be **./gradlew** instead of **gradlew**

# TODOs and Considerations
- I was storing the whole notification content in one variable, but I could parsed it into separate attributes like notification title, issue name, description, etc.  I wasnâ€™t sure if this was necessary.
- I fetch only notifications for the user associated with the provided token.
- I added the option for the user to choose a project from all available ones, since an issue must be created for a specific project.
- Notifications are retrieved every 60 seconds.
